===========

Haivng trouble with github shell crashing when trying to do whole project so nixed large files like audio. Also nixed the default unity boilerplate since it was hanging on converting LF's (I know right?). All the guts are there, though if you want a better, and ready to runb experiance go here and get the full source. You can just open it right up in unity.
